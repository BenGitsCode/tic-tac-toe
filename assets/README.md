The main creative spin I focused on was using images of Xzibit and Oprah instead of X's and O's because they are both great sources of funny gifs, and because alliteration is great.

Data Structure-
  -I used Html and bootstrap css as the foundation for my project.
  -I originally started writing vanilla javascript for my game logic, switched to jQuery when I realized I would have to translate it into that after, and wasted some more valuable time bouncing between the two methods instead of incrementally following through with one or the other.
  -I used ajax requests to communicate CRUDs to the api and may have saved time in troubleshooting them if I had utilized curl requests to test them as they were built.
  -I tried to use local images in my assets directory as player tokens in my board but ran into countless issues incorporating them properly. I would consistently time block 30 minute segments to work on this, in an effort to not waste time on it--as it was a non-essential aesthetic element in our deliverables requirement--but continued to block out small chunks for it as it was the cornerstone to my creative spin and tonal focus of my user story beyond pure mechancical function.
  -I definitely made changes to my wireframe, but generally maintained the gestalt of its original design.
    -Even in making a simple wireframe, I hade never communicated such a design into front-end presentation before, so the gap between "i want it to look like this" and "how i will make it look like This" was vast--providing an immense learning experience. That same gap was present in almost every space between design and execution of code to get there, be it html, css or js.

Issues:

  -The biggest issue I ran into with that was that I didn't have the foresight to build the structure of my javascript game logic around that conceit. This resulted in me getting my game logic working, and not being able to incorporate images as player tokens without a high risk of breaking my game logic, or its connection the api.

  -Whether I coud go back and start over, or have more time to work on it, I would want to structure the game logic around that concept from the start or refactor my current code around it, respectively.
  -I didn't have enough time to get truly comfortable with css before starting the project, which made my original approach of "build the html and css skeleton first, and then build functionality into it" actually consume the majority of my first 20-40 hours, instead of being a simple foundation step.
    -using bootstrap allowed me to weave around some of those tasks with fancy bootstrap shortcuts faster than hard-oding all of my style elements would have been--but not yet having familiarity with bootstrap idiosyncicies created more speed bumps as well.
